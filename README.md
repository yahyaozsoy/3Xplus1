 Is there any way to find something else other than 1?

## Where all this came from?
I know what you will think about, what's all that about?

Let me explain.

This is about a video¹ which my friend send me about a mathematical problem.
Then, I really wonder that *"Is it can be true?"* and I started this project for find out.

## How can I use it?
After downloading project², you should just **simply cilck *main.py*** and it will generate a **log** for you.
When it closed you should click to the **.txt** file and open it and see what's the answer.

### If you found the answer of first question please contact with me
