Is there any way to find something other than 1?

## Where all this came from?
I know what you will think about, what's all that about?

Let me explain.

This is about a video¹ which my friend send me about a mathematical problem.
It says: 
>**First pick a number, if your number is odd you should multiply by 3 and add 1 but, 
>if your number is even you should divide it by 2. You should go on applying this rule until it becomes 1...
>They tried to find out is there a number that goes to infinite... And 2⁶⁸ quantity of numbers have tried by them...**

Then, I really started wonder that *"Is there a way to find something other than 1?"* by that I started this project for find out.

## How can I use it?
After downloading project², you should just **simply cilck *main.py*** and it will generate a **log** for you.
When it closed you should click to the **.txt** file and open it and see what's the answer.
