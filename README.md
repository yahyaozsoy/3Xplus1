Is there any way to find something other than 1?

## Where all this came from?
I know what you will think about, what's all that about?

Let me explain.

This is about a [video¹](https://github.com/yahyaozsoy/3Xplus1#links) which my friend send me, about a mathematical problem.
It says: 
>**First pick a number, if your number is odd you should multiply by 3 and add 1 but, 
>if your number is even you should divide it by 2. You should go on applying this rule until it becomes 1...
>They tried to find out is there a number that goes to infinite... And 2⁶⁸ quantity of numbers have tried by them...**

Then, I really started wonder that *"Is there a way to find something other than 1?"* by that I started this project for find out.

## How can I use it?
After downloading [project²](https://github.com/yahyaozsoy/3Xplus1#links) and [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)(you can use every version which is 3.6 and above), you should just **simply cilck *main.py*** and it will generate a **log** and a **chart** for you.
When it closed you can click to the **.txt** file which is located in logs folder, to see the log.

***Note:** If it doesn't start, you should open your Command Prompt and write `pip install numpy` and `pip install matplotlib` with that you can freely open the file.*
